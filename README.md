Measurement of a song's success is a relative matter. It could be assessed based on volume of sales, how popular it might be or from a purely artistic point of view regarding its aesthetics and characteristics.

For this project, I have defined as a measure of song success: whether a song  was listed in the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and therefore classified as a "hit".  

I obtained and combined relevant data to predict whether a song can become a "hit" based on its audio features. 

This analysis does not account for other possible confounding factors, such as marketing, performer abilities and trajectory, social or geographical environment, among others factors that could have a direct influence on a song becoming a hit.

The repository includes the following files:

- An Rmd file report detailing the methodology applied, 
- A PDF report (issued from the Rmd file above mentioned), 
- A Html version of the report, and 
- An R script file that generates the analysis and  predictions
